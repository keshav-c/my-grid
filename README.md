# DESIGN YOUR OWN GRID-BASED FRAMEWORK

The goal of this project is to 

1. Design a grid based CSS framework with provisioning to create

    - A grid container
    - grid rows
    - grid columns of varying spans
    - fixed size gutters

2. Use the created framework to clone a chosen website.

## Approach

We have used Sass language (scss) to concisely describe our framework,
that fulfils the basic requirements. The generated CSS file,
`framework.css`, is then used to clone the home page of the *A List Apart*
[website](https://alistapart.com/)

## Project Navigation

- `.scss` source for the framework in `~/styles/scss`
- the compiled `framework.css` in `~/styles`
- the framework is demoed in `~/index.html`.
- the clone of **alistapart** is in the `alistapart`
    
    * The cloned home page in `~/alistapart/index.html`
